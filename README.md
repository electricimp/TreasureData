# TreasureData #

This library allows your agent code to send data to the [Treasure Data platform](https://www.treasuredata.com) via the [Treasure Data REST API](https://support.treasuredata.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000675487-Postback-API).

**To add this library to your project, add** `#require "TreasureData.agent.lib.nut:1.0.0"` **to the top of your agent code**

## Library Usage ##

### Prerequisites ###

Before using the library you need to have:

- A [Treasure Data API key](https://support.treasuredata.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000763288-Get-API-Keys). For data sending operations the Write-only key is enough.
- Preconfigured [Treasure Data database and table](https://support.treasuredata.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001266348-Database-and-Table-Management).

### Examples ###

Working examples are provided in the [Examples](./Examples) directory.

### Callbacks ###

All requests that are made to the Treasure Data platform occur asynchronously. Every method that sends a request has an optional parameter which takes a callback function that will be executed when the operation is completed, whether successfully or not. The callbackâ€™s parameters are listed in the corresponding method description, but every callback has at least one parameter, *error*. If *error* is `null`, the operation has been executed successfully. Otherwise, *error* is [HTTP response table](https://electricimp.com/docs/api/httprequest/sendasync/) and contains the details of the error.

## TreasureData Class ##

### Constructor: TreasureData(*apiKey*) ###

This method returns a new TreasureData instance.

| Parameter | Data Type | Required? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *apiKey* | String | Yes | [Treasure Data API key](https://support.treasuredata.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000763288-Get-API-Keys) |

```
#require "TreasureData.agent.lib.nut:1.0.0"

const MY_API_KEY = "<YOUR_TREASURE_DATA_API_KEY>";

treasureData <- TreasureData(MY_API_KEY);
```

### sendData(*dbName, tableName, data[, callback]*) ###

This method sends data record to the specified Treasure Data table. For more information, please see [the Treasure Data documentation](https://support.treasuredata.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000675487-Postback-API#POST%20%2Fpostback%2Fv3%2Fevent%2F%7Bdatabase%7D%2F%7Btable%7D).

| Parameter | Data Type | Required? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *dbName* | String | Yes | [Treasure Data database name](https://support.treasuredata.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001266348-Database-and-Table-Management) |
| *tableName* | String | Yes | [Treasure Data table name](https://support.treasuredata.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001266348-Database-and-Table-Management) |
| *data* | Key-Value Table | Yes | The data to send &mdash; a key-value table, where a "key" is the name of the field (column) in the database table, the "value" is the value to be written into that field. |
| *callback* | Function | Optional | Executed once the operation is completed |

This method returns nothing. The result of the operation may be obtained via the *callback* function, which has the following parameter:

| Parameter | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *error* | table | Error details, [HTTP response table](https://electricimp.com/docs/api/httprequest/sendasync/), or `null` if the operation succeeds |
| *data* | Key-Value Table | The original data passed to the `sendData()` method |

```
const DATABASE_NAME = "<YOUR_DATABASE_NAME>";
const TABLE_NAME = "<YOUR_TABLE_NAME>";

treasureData.sendData(
    DATABASE_NAME,
    TABLE_NAME,
    { "column1" : "value", "column2" : 123 },
    function (error, data) {
        if (error) {
            server.error("Sending data failed: status code " + error.statuscode);
        }
    }.bindenv(this));
```

### setDebug(*value*) ###

This method enables (*value* is `true`) or disables (*value* is `false`) the library debug output (including error logging). It is disabled by default. The method returns nothing.
